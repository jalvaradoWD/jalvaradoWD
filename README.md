# Hello World! 🌎

Hi, I'm Jose Alvarado. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with passion for open-source projects and web technologies.

* Not only I'm interested in web technologies, I want to work on 3D animation software like Blender.
* Pop! OS (Linux) is my go to operating system. 🐧
* Since I'm using Linux, I would also expand my knowledge on learning Dev Ops in the near future. 🖥
